### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jaesik Yoon working in SAP as a Machine Learning Developer. Now I am working with Professor [Sungjin Ahn](https://sungjinahn.com/) at Rutgers University for ML research, particularly unsupervised learning and object-oriented learning. Besides career, I am a husband of beautiful lady and a dad of very curious son who always gives me intuition how human learns the world.
